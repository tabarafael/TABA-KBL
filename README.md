## Summary


## The begining

So it all started a few months ago, as I had a hand injury.
After examination from the doctor it became clear that my wrist and forearm were already suffering from RSI (Repetitive strain injury) and the injury I had was just what tipped it over the edge into a state of constant pain even for the more mundain of tasks.
Soon I stopped with some of my hobbies like playing the piano and competitive weight lifting so to aleviate said pain.

So that marks the start of a search for a more ergonomic environment.

## Keyboards

While I could stop some activities like I said, what pays my bills is still software development, so I had to find some solution for my mouse and keyboard.

First came the basics like cushioning, but soon I knew I needed something other than that.
Got myself a split keyboard and while the board is amazing, there was something missing.

You see, typing on a keyboard can encompass many different techniques.
Usualy people such as myself will type with whatever finger and hand seems more comfortable at that moment.

Problem being: on a split keyboand you will have to at least respect what letter falls onto which hand.
